                    <p>Artist Laurel Schwulst’s article explains the purposes of websites, why the web should be shaped and driven by individuals rather than powerful corporations, and lists the different types of websites. Schwulst begins by identifying the problems modern users face when using sites of large companies like Instagram, where financial gain is prioritized above the users’ emotional wellbeing. For example, Instagram enables users to reach large audiences, but Instagram still has control over individual content (e.g. using content to improve their AI). Moreover, Schwulst explains the importance of personal websites in today’s digital age, where artists/individuals should reclaim agency of their content on the web by creating their own websites. I think tension stems from how users are generally willing to trade their emotional autonomy for wider exposure, because personal websites carry less visibility. Furthermore, Schwulst underscores the benefits of personal websites, allowing one to own their content as the author and design their site as the architect. This would allow an artist, like myself, to strategically present artworks that infuse concepts into the web structure, enriching the user experience.</p>

                <p>J.R. Carpenter’s article is written in short paragraphs, her website is made in an early interface web design style. She introduces the idea of “handmade web pages” in the mid-1990s, a time where web pages were organized by individuals rather than large companies, but it was inevitable to be washed away by new professional tools that ultimately dominate the web today. She correlates early personal webs with handmade print materials (e.g. zines), reinforcing her argument of how individual webs are different from corporation-owned ones. By providing an example of her own earlier web work about an installation, she encourages the viewers to consider handmade websites to be the same as prints, both involving individuality and creativity.  
                    <br>
                    Then, she explains that she now owns a copy of a book version of her installation and a corrupt digital file of it, but emphasises that the handmade web still exists. This reminds me of the increasing impermanence of websites today compared to 1995, where most webs today are locked in large platforms (Google, Instagram, etc.). When one of those powerful corporations today shuts down or deletes an account, all years of an individual’s personal work on it cannot be restored. This frightens me, as I often wonder: What would I lose if Instagram/Google Drive one day vanishes? There were past examples, like MySpace, that deleted massive personal accounts due to their system failure - I wonder if my artworks posted on a site under a platform are now solely owned by the platform.  If credentials still last on the web today like they did in the past is a question I ponder. 
                    <br>
                    Carpenter mentions that when viewing older webs nowadays, we can encounter errors or missing links/images, but she suggests that seeing past webs should inform us of modern ones. She argues that a handmade web should be an ongoing process and continually edited, encouraging viewers, like myself, to actively engage in archiving old webs. I believe old sites still have value, as they show us how coding techniques evolved, and I can always learn from how it's built. Amidst the information overload, Carpenter explains how more people are revisiting older styles, like Web 1.0 aesthetics, which is another way to resist the dominance of corporate networks. This reminds me that when I create web content, I want my work to reflect my own effort and ideas, rather than only adapting to the trend.</p>

            <p>This chapter of Taeyoon Choi’s book effectively guides the readers through the writings, where Choi outlines a brief history of computers, its myth, and its significant impacts on our lives nowadays. He uses simple, compelling images that help strengthen each of his ideas. Choi began by providing an in-depth view into the importance of history behind “computation”. Choi states that although early technological developments stem from the military, which later became part of the Silicon Valley mythology. Choi suggests that this myth creates a popular/widely accepted narrative  centered around praising the  successes of individuals who single-handedly created early tech companies (like Steve Jobs), but yet intentionally leaves out reality, such as mass production and intensive labor. This leads me to think of how politics may be an equally important factor as innovation when it comes to computer advancements. I wonder whose stories were preserved or left out  from this popular, dominant narrative and why. This reminds me of the “myth” of the masculine heroic narratives popular in the US, yet many Black Mountain artists tried to resist. 
               <br>
                However, in modern times, financial incentives are the main driving force of technological advancements. Choi mentions that companies profit from people’s daily attention and data from their devices, which we know helped them gain more control, while simultaneously interfaces were designed to be simpler to reach a larger customer base. This makes me wonder just how much personal information is used that I am unaware of when visiting a site.  Choi broaches the idea that computation, architecture and painting are interconnected, with a common goal of efficiency. He underscores the idea of a city, which is connected through human-scale circuits, where he then encourages the viewers to think about the complexities and differences of a city and the computer. Where cities allow for emotions and diversity, I think cities are more than computers, in that they do not stick to a routine and try to avoid unpredictability. This makes me ponder to what extent am I living in cities today  where I can take ownership of my own webs/learning, and sometimes  follow patterns without thinking.
