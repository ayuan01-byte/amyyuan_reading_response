    <p>Artist Laurel Schwulst’s article explains the purposes of websites, why the web should be shaped and driven by individuals rather than powerful corporations, and lists the different types of websites. Schwulst begins by identifying the problems modern users face when using sites of large companies like Instagram, where financial gain is prioritized above the users’ emotional wellbeing. For example, Instagram enables users to reach large audiences, but Instagram still has control over individual content (e.g. using content to improve their AI). Moreover, Schwulst explains the importance of personal websites in today’s digital age, where artists/individuals should reclaim agency of their content on the web by creating their own websites. I think tension stems from how users are generally willing to trade their emotional autonomy for wider exposure, because personal websites carry less visibility. Furthermore, Schwulst underscores the benefits of personal websites, allowing one to own their content as the author and design their site as the architect. This would allow an artist, like myself, to strategically present artworks that infuse concepts into the web structure, enriching the user experience.</p>
